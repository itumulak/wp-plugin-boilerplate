# WP Plugin Boilerplate

This is a modern approach (I think) for building Enterprise WordPress plugins. I have consolidated all necessary tech stack that I know off that makes building scalable, enterprise-level plugins that will power your WordPress application.
## 🚀 Features

✅ **MVC Architecture**: Separation of Models, Views, and Controllers for **maintainability and clean code**. <br>
✅ **Dependency Injection**: This promotes **loose coupling, testability, and reusability**. <br>
✅ **React Frontend**: Use modern JavaScript (React) for dynamic UI parts. <br>
✅ **Autoloading** via PSR-4 standards (Composer). <br>
✅ **Hook Management**: Organized action and filter registration. <br>
✅ **WP REST API**: Build robust, scalable RESTful endpoints using the native **WordPress REST API framework**. <br>
✅ **Scalable Structure**: Designed with scalability in mind — easy to extend without being **limited** by rigid architecture. <br>
✅ **Unit testing**: Built-in PHPUnit setup for testing use cases — helps catch regressions early and ensures code reliability. <br>
✅ **PHP Code Sniffers**: Enforces **WordPress Coding Standards** using phpcs to maintain code consistency and improve readability. <br>

## ⚙️ Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- WordPress 5.8+
- Node.js + npm (for React build)
- Composer

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/itumulak/wp-plugin-biolerplate.git
```

2. **Install PHP Dependencies**

```sh
composer install
```

3. **Install frontend dependencies and build React:**

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. **Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin dashboard.**

## 🧪 Development

### React Development

Ensure that your React components are registered in ``vite.config.js``.

```js
...
        v4wp({
            input: {
                samplenotes: 'src/pages/SampleNotes/main.jsx', // Add your react components.
            },
            outDir: 'dist'
        }),
    ],
...
```

To build and compile:

```sh
npm run build
```

### Gutenburg Development

Create your start Block:

```sh
cd ./src/blocks
npx @wordpress/create-block your-block-folder
```

To build and compile:

```sh
npm run build:blocks
```

### Compile plugin into ZIP

```sh
composer zip
```

## Detecting code violation and auto-fixes

For checking for formatting issues:

```sh
composer phpcs <REPLACE_WITH_PHP_PATH_FILES>

```

To fix formats and coding violation. For simple formats/violation only:

```sh
composer phpcbf <REPLACE_WITH_PHP_PATH_FILES>
```

By default we are using WordPress coding standard for sniffing out code violation. I have filter out a few rule here. Feel free modify ``phpcs.xml`` if you want modify the sniffer rules to meet your objectives.

## Unit Testing

To unit test:

```sh
composer test
```

Feel free to include your own unit test to meet your objectives.

## Github Workflow (CI)

This project includes a Github Workflow. It simply run unit testing and PHPCS for code violation. Feel free to add more steps.

## Running your own local server (optional)

<details>

<summary>Docker setup</summary> <br/>


This project comes with a `docker-compose.yml` file that lets you spin up a fully functional local WordPress development environment using Docker.

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

Copy `docker-compose.yml` to your project.

```sh
mkdir /var/www/html/<PROJECT_NAME_PATH>
cd $_
cp  <PATH_OF_WP_PLUGIN_BOILERPLATE>/docker-composer.yml /var/www/html/<PROJECT_NAME_PATH> && <PATH_OF_WP_PLUGIN_BOILERPLATE>/.env /var/www/html/<PROJECT_NAME_PATH>
```

Run `docker-compose.yml`.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Go to https://localhost:8080 (or what port you have define in `.env`) and complete the wordpress installation.

Copy the whole WP Plugin Boilerplate folder into your working wordpress docker instance.

```sh
cp -r <PATH_OF_WP_PLUGIN_BOILERPLATE> /var/www/html/<PROJECT_NAME_PATH>/wordpress_data/wp-content/plugins/
```
